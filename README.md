# Otaku-Tac-Toe
My first ever game made using Pygame - Basic Tic Tac Toe 

Each part of my program contains a brief explanation of what is being done.

Looking back, there are much cleaner/more efficient ways to code parts of my game, but as a person who is very new to Python and Pygame, this is what I was able to put together.
